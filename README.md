# BuddyPress Notifications Plugin

> More extendable replacement of default BuddyPress notifications. 

This is drop-in replacement for Activity notification messages.  I build this to showcase more “OOP way” of handling notifications in BP.  Converts long `switch` statements to Polymorphism.

# Basic Usage
WIP. Meanwhile check `src/Messages` for examples.

# Installation
1. Clone repo into plugins directory.
2. `composer install`
